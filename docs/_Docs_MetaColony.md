The Meta Colony is “the Colony colony” — it’s remit is to develop, support, and grow the Colony Network. Every colony on the public network needs the Meta Colony, and everyone may be a member.

The Meta Colony has special permissions, including the ability to add, remove, or modify the skill tags used by all colonies on the Colony Network.

## CLNY
CLNY is the Token of “The Meta Colony”.

CLNY is a hybrid Token which combines the benefits of both a Work Token and a Burn & Mint Equilibrium model.

Just like in a "normal" colony, accounts holding both CLNY and Reputation in the Meta Colony may claim a share of the revenue of the Meta Colony proportional to combined Reputation and CLNY holdings.

### Work Token
CLNY is staked in the Meta Colony to:
* Create or evaluate work
* Raise or defend disputes
* Curate the App registry
* Participate in Reputation Mining
